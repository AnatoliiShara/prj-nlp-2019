Ukrainian language punctuation checking

Ukrainian Wikipedia corpus will be used as source of truth.
All texts from wiki are considered as correct examples.
Negative examples will be generated by deletion and by random adding commas.

Proposed architecture:
Bi-RNN will be used to derive regularities from corpus.
Input - word embedding with POS tag for each word in sentence.
